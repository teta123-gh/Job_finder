# Job Finder App

The **Job Finder App** is a simple web application that allows users to search for jobs using the [JSearch API](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch/) from RapidAPI. Users can enter a job title or keyword, and the app will display matching job listings with details and application links.

- 🔍 Search jobs by keyword (e.g., "Software Engineer", "Designer", "Remote")
- 📍 Displays job title, company name, and location
